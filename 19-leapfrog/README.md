Leapfrog is children's activity in which one person hops over another person who is bent over. You probably remember doing this as a child (or adult, no judgment here).

In this etude, you will focus on dynamic memory allocation and pointer management though the manipulation of a singly linked list.

1. Each node represents a player in the game. The node `struct` has already been defined for you in `leapfrog.h`.
2. You will need to implement the functions in `leapfrog.c` to manage the linked list. Function headers have been provided to guide you.
3. In `main.c`, implement a simple user interface to add players, display the list of players, and make them leapfrog over each other based on user input.
4. Compile and run your program to verify that the players are hopping correctly.
