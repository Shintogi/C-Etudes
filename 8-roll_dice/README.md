# 8. Dice Rolling

Create a program which simulates rolling a collection of dice for a table top game.
The user should be able to keep rolling until they choose to exit.
You can implement this as a menu, or through a special input the user must enter.

The user input should follow the format `NdX` where `N` is the number of dice to roll, and `X` is the number of sides on each die.

For example, if the user inputs `3d6`, the program should roll three six-sided dice and return the result of each die roll.

**Example Run**
```
Press ENTER to roll. Input Q to quit.
> 2d8
You rolled: 5, 3 totalling 8
> 4d10
You rolled: 7, 1, 10, 4 totalling 22
> Q
Good bye! Nice to know you.
```
