# 9. Dynamic Stack

Create a dynamic stack library that can work with ANY data type.
The stack should support two major operations: `push` and `pop`.

## Getting Started

The following key questions need to be addressed:
1. How do we represent a stack in C?
2. What needs to be done when we `push` an element onto the stack?
3. What needs to be done when we `pop` an element from the stack?
4. How do we make the stack dynamic so that it can grow and shrink as needed?
5. How do we ensure that the stack can handle any data type?
6. How do we manage memory effectively to avoid leaks and ensure efficiency?

Remember to organize your code so that stack operations are encapsulated within their own file. A separate test file should be created to demonstrate the functionality of the stack with different data types.
